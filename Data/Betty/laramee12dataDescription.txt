The data is in .raw. It's just x,y,z components of
the vector field (I believe 8-bit -> bias by 0.5
needed), in x,y,z straightforward ordering (simpler
than simple).

Subtract 0.5 so that values from [0,1] get transformed
to [-0.5,+0.5].

The data set size is in .dat.

I produced the simulation data myself using NaSt3D.
