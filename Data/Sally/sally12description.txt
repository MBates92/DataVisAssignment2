Robert,

The sally is just a rather random function I invented to generate a 
pretty vector field. One that I could control and had enough richness to it. 
I have seen the cone before, mainly the bigger one. Have not seen the little 
one on the core. I believe there might be some discontinuities (in some 
derivative) so it may lead to some problems in certain algorithms. Hope this 
helps.

Roger
